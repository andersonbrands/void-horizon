After my student account had been deleted I lost access to the original source control repository. So the source code I have here is really not properly structured, as well as it is not garanteed to be the latest version. Again, it is just for reference porpuses.

You can find the final Windows executable, along with asset files, in Release folder.

There's also a video trailer for you to enjoy!


This is a foundation to a more elaborate project, which can be found here: https://github.com/andersonbrands/shu-swb-base-project
